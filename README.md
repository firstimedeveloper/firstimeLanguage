This is a tool that automatically creates flashcards (to be used via anki, quizlet) from Youtube videos with subtitles. The subtitles are taken from the video itself and a translation (if not provided by the uploader) will be generated through google translate. The user can edit or remove any fields before exporting an anki/quizlet/etc compatible file. Future feature updates include; automatically adding audio files, a separate mobile app for quick rewinding/fast-forwarding of the video while using dual subtitles.
